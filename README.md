[00:02.24] When it's late at night, I speak to the moon
[00:08.90] It sings to me in sweet melodies, a tune
[00:16.06] Says, "Boy, you know you've fallin' in her trance"
[00:23.81] Even though she messes up your day plans (hm)
[00:46.31] 
[00:30.77] You're in love
[00:34.63] I can see something's hiding underneath
[00:45.79] You're in love
[00:49.51] I can tell
[00:53.34] You're already under her spell
[01:08.34] 
[01:01.23] Well
[01:02.21] No, that can't be
[01:03.96] No, not just yet
[01:09.46] Not falling for some girl that I just met
[01:16.15] So, quit telling me that she's the one (she's the lady of your dreams, oh)
[01:23.92] When the story that you're writing hasn't even begun
[01:49.92] 
[01:30.67] I'm not in love
[01:34.63] I can see
[01:38.59] It's a story not made for me
[01:45.23] Said I'm not in love
[01:49.52] I can't tell
[01:53.38] No, I don't believe in her spells
[02:09.88] 
[02:01.29] But, maybe it's working on me
[02:05.91] (Maybe it's working on me)
[02:08.51] 'Cause when I close my eyes night, she's all I see
[02:16.33] Or maybe it's all in my head
[02:23.22] But I know that I'd much rather have her in my heart instead
[02:53.22] 
[02:30.80] I'm in love
[02:34.70] Now I see
[02:38.66] Oh, she's had a hold on me
[02:45.77] I'm in love
[02:49.74] Yes, it's true
[02:53.11] I thought I'd tell you
[02:56.97] About my conversation with the moon
